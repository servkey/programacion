So that was a big one.
But you'll be glad to know
that composition and aggregation is going to be quite quick.
So here is our example where
we have our college class as
usual, but colleges contain
departments, and this solid diamond
here is the composition operator
that says that we have objects
from the right hand side class that
are components of the left hand side objects.
So let's look at the translation to relations.
We'll translate the college side
as usual with a key
attribute - college name and the other attributes.
And then although this is an
association, we're not going
to have a separate class for
it, we're going to have the
right hand side class
have both the values of
the object in that class
and the association captured together.
So we'll have a relation called
department, and it
will have the department name
and the building and then
it will also include, the
key of the object it belongs to.
So in this case, that would be a college name.
Now if you think carefully about it,
this translation actually makes a
lot of sense and is consistent with
what we've already done.
We said when we introduced
the notion of composition that we
have Effectively have by definition
a one dot dot, one on the left hand side of the composition.
So if we treated this
as a regular association, used our
regular translation and then
used our rule that allowed
us to get rid of association
relations, we'd actually end up at exactly the same design.
By the way this is a last
example where we have a
class that's not one of those
regular classes that require a key.
We don't have to have a
key for the right-hand side
of a composition in order to have an automatic translation.
Aggregation, by the way,
was the case where we have
the MC diamond and
that's implicitly a zero dot
dot one instead of one dot dot one.
We had an example with apartment
buildings, I'm not going to
bother to give that one again,
but in that case where we have an aggregation should have in an association.
All we need is the same
design but the ability for
that key we're grabbing from the
left hand side to be
null, and, then, everything works out fine.
So, to conclude, the data modeling
portion of UML, is a
popular high level language for database designs.
It's graphical and it can
be translated automatically
to relations, as long as
every regular class has a key, and that typically is the case.
