In this video we're going to
learn about translating designs in
the UML modelling inter-relational schemas.
As a reminder if the
application developer is using a
high level design model then
they will create their design usually
using a graphical language that's
sent to a translator and the
translator will then produce
a schema using the data
model of the underline database
management system, which frequently is relational.
So, in our case we're looking at
high level design in the
UML data modeling subset which
is then translated to
relations and installed in a relational database system.
It's this translation process that's the topic of this video.
In the data model of subset
of UML, we have five
concepts that we learned in
the previous video and we'll
see now that designs using these
concepts can be translated to
relations automatically with one
provision which is that every
regular class has a key.
And we'll see what we mean by a regular class in a moment.
So, what we're going to
do is go through each one of
these concepts one at a
time and show show how
the concepts are translated to relations.
For our examples we'll use
primarily the same examples that
we used in the previous video where we introduced UML.
For classes will have a
student class and a college class.
Our students have a student
ID which is the primary key,
a student name and a GPA
and our colleges will have a
college name which we'll assume
is unique, so that's the primary
key, the state and the enrollment.
The translation from classes to
relations is absolutely direct
we take the student class and
we make a relation called student,
we put the three attributes
down for that relation and
then the primary key from
the student class becomes the key attribute in that relation.
And similarly our college relation
has the college name as
a key, the state, and the enrollment.
So all we're doing to turn
classes into relation is basically turning them side ways.
So now we're done with classes and let's move on to associations.
We'll see that each association is
going to be translated to its
own relation that grabs a
key from each side of the
association so let's go
to our example, the same one we
used earlier, that has students applying to colleges.
So, here's our diagram, with
students applying to colleges and
we'll already have generated the
two relations for our classes,
the student and the college relation
and for the association applied
between students and colleges we
create a relation, we call
it applied and that relation
has attributes the keys
from both sides so that
would be the student ID from
the student class and the
college name from the college class.
And if you think about it it makes a lot of sense.
Applied is capturing relationships between
students and colleges so we'll
capture each of those relationships
with one tuple in the
applied relation identifying the student
with the key and the college with the key.
Now one question you might have
is what is the key
for a relation that we
generate from an association, it
turns out that depends on the
concept of multiplicity that we
learned about in the previous video
so let me setup a generic
example of two classes
with an association and then and
we'll talk about multiplicity and keys.
Ok, so here we have both classes.
We'll call them C1 and C2.
And each one has
a key attribute, we called it
K1 and K2 over here
and then one other attribute 01
and 02 and then we have an association
A between the two classes.
So in terms of their relations
that will be generated, we'll have for
C1, K1-01 with K1
as a key for C2 we'll
have K2-02 with K2
as key and then
for our association A, we'll
grab the key from each
side, K1 and K2 and
the question we have now is,
what is the key for relation A?
Well, as a default the key
can be both attributes together, but
in certain cases we can
be more specific, and again
that's going to depend on the
multiplicity on our association.
Let's suppose that our multiplicity is 0..1
on the left hand side and a
star on the right hand side
and let's look at what
that represents in terms of the type of relationship we're capturing.
And, I'll make sure get it right
this time, so what this
is saying here is that if
we have objects of C1
on the left hand side,
each one can be related to
many objects of C2
on the right hand side, but
each object of C2 can
be only be related to at
most one object of
C1, and some of them might not be related to any.
So remember now, it's
these edges that are being
captured by the tuples in
our relation for the association,
and we can see that
each element on the right
hand side can only be
involved in at most one
tuple of A, so
that tells us that K2
is actually a key for
A. So when we
have zero dot dot
one or one dot dot one, for that matter.
On the left side, or
on one side of an association,
then the key attribute from
the other side is a key for the association.
So lets test out that rule
on our student and college
association and see if it makes sense.
So I've drawn the association here
and we're interested in the
relation that's going to be
generated for the association
itself which will be the applied
relation with the student ID
on one side from one side
and the college name from the
other, so that's the relation
we're going to generate for the
association and the question
is what's key for that relation.
Well, let's add the constraint
that every student applies to exactly one college.
So, that would be a one dot
dot one on the right and
then a star on the
left if a college can have any number of applicants.
So, our rule of thumb,
it's actually a rule, said
that if we have one dot dot
one or zero dot one dot
dot one on one side then
the other side would be the key.
So that would tell us
that if we have this one
dot dot one on the right
that student ID would be
a key for applied and indeed
that makes complete sense if each
student can only apply to
one college, then, they will
indeed be a in the applied relation.
Now there's actually a related concept here
where we might need a
relation for associations at all
and again, that depends on
multiplicity and again let's start with a generic example.
so here's our generic example and
from this our standard translation
would give us three relations, one
for C1, one for C2
and then one capturing the association
A which would have a key from each side.
Now, what we're going to discover, is
that in come cases it's actually
possible to fold relations
A into either C1 or
C2 will end up with
just two relation instead of
three and will be capturing the same information.
So let's suppose we have a 1..1
and on our left hand side
so again we're going to have
the situation where from the
left side to the right
we have a fan out so
each one on the right is
related to exactly one on the left.
If that's the case,
then instead of having a
separate relation for the
associations basically for capturing
these edges here, we can
simply take the related element
up from the left, the key
from the left and add it to the element for the right.
Let me show how that's done.
So what we'll do is we'll
change this C2 to have
K2 and O go to
as before, but also to
have the key from the
left hand side of class,
or relation so the key
from C-1, and then we don't need A any longer.
And we can see why that works,
because every element in C2
is related to exactly one element
in C-1, so we just
add the key for that single
element that is related to that relation.
Now, what if the left hand
side were zero dot dot one instead of one dot dot one?
In that case, it would be
possible for there to be
some elements in C2 that
aren't related to any elements
in C1, and that would
still be okay with this
design as long as null
values would be allowed in
the third attribute of the relation for C-2.
And finally, what's the key to this relation?
Well, we knew before that the
key for C2 was K2,
just by definition of it
being the primary key for the
class, and that's still the
case in the expanded C2.
K2 will still be a
key because we'll only have
one instance of each
object and the one K
one that it would be related to through the association.
So what we saw, to summarize,
is that when we have zero
dot dot one or one dot
dot one on one aside and
then we have an association and instead
of making a relation for the
association we can add
the key from the side
with the zero dot dot one
or one dot dot one, to the
relation that we generated for the class on the right hand side.
So, let's take a look again
with students and colleges just to confirm this intuition.
So let's again suppose that a
student applies to exactly one
college and our rule
of thumb says that we have
a one dot dot one on
one side, then we can
take the key from that
side and add it to
the relation for the other side
so we would be adding to
the student relation, the college
name attribute and we'd
be getting rid of applied entirely.
Let's just think about if that
makes sense if every student
is applying to exactly one college,
it makes perfectly good sense to
just add that college name to
the student relation and furthermore
if we had students
just applying to either zero
or one college, that would
still be an acceptable design provided
that null values are allowed for
the college name attribute.
