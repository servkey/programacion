Ok, we've finished with classes and with
associations, now let's talk about associations classes.
Association classes are pretty straight forward.
We're not going to generate new
relations more then we're just
going to add attributes to
relations that we're generating anyway,
so let me use our usual example
with the students and colleges and
we'll add some information to their application.
Ok, so, here's our UML diagram.
We still have students applying to
colleges and then we've added
an association class, which
as you remember is attached to
an association and it
gives extra attributes for that association.
So, here we're saying when a
student applies to a college,
we'll have a date of that
application and a decision of that application.
The first scheme that I've
shown down here is what
we would get if we use
the techniques we've already learned without
the association class so the student
class generates the student relation,
college generates college and then
the applied association generates a
relation that has a key from each side.
And by the way, right now
let's say that there's no
multiplicities or other
information that's going to give
us special keys so in
that case the applied relation doesn't
have any keys other than
the two attributes together.
And further more, because we
have no special multiplicities, we
won't be folding that relation
into others as we showed in the previous example.
So, now what do we do with our association class?
Well, as you can probably guess, it's quite simple.
All we do is extend our
applied relation to include
the attributes in the association class.
So, we just add date and
decision right here and then we're all set.
Now there's actually a few things I want to mention at this point.
First of all, I discussed in
the video on UMO modeling.
The fact that UMO assumes
that when you have a relationship or
an association between two
classes, there's at most
one instance of that
association between any two elements of the class.
And that is, can be
seen quite well in this
relational scheme up because
we're assuming we have a
most one relationship between any
student and any college and
then we have associated with that
one relationship, the date and the decision.
A second thing I wanted
to talk about at this point
in time is the fact that
we for an automatic translation require
that we have a key for every regular class.
When I mentioned that at the
beginning of the video, I wasn't
able to motivate it very
well but this example explains it pretty well.
When we want automatic translation, the
translation for an association
requires a key from each
side, and each side
is going to be a regular class in that case.
So, we needed to have a
student ID or some
key for the student class and
we needed a key for the
college class in order to capture the association.
On the other hand, here the
application info is not
a regular class, this is
an association class and we're
just defining that as not
regular and we don't need
to have a key for this one
because we're just adding their
attributes to the relation
for the association itself and the
last thing that I wanted to mention
is that the rules we
saw for determining keys for
the relation associated with associations
and for folding in the
class and relations for associations
also work when we have
an association class and it just goes naturally.
You just bring the attributes with
the association class along with
the attributes that you have for the association.
You might want to give that
a try on an example just to
see how it works but again it's pretty straight forward.
Now let's take a look at
how self associations are translated to relations.
It actually follows exactly the same
rules but it's worth while looking at to see exactly what happens.
So here's our first example
of association which was sibling
relationships between students.
So in this case, we generate
the relation for the class
as usual, student ID, name and
GPA and then we
generate a relation for our
association just following the
same that we already had
when we had an association between
two different classes so we
need to grab one key from
each side, well it's the
same side that we're
grabbing from so the one
thing we need to do is just
change the attribute names
so that we have two instances
of the key attribute from the class, but they have different names.
So you can see what we're doing here.
We're just saying that we have sibling relationship.
We take the student ID from
the two students who are
siblings, and that pair
becomes a tuple in our
sibling relation and because
so we have stars on both sides
so we're not making any assumptions about multiplicities.
We don't have any zero dot dot ones or one dot dot ones.
Then we don't have any key
for the sibling relation except the two attributes together.
Now, the other example we had
in self-association, was colleges
being branches of other colleges.
So here's our college relation
that we generate with the
usual attributes and then
we have our, that's the key there.
We have our association which we're
calling branch which takes
a home campus and a
satellite campus and since we've
labeled those two sides we can
actually use those labels as
the attributes for the relation we generate.
So we'll call it branch and
we'll have home and satellite.
So that's saying that the
satellite, the campus on
the, the college on the
right hand side is a
satellite of the one on the left hand side.
Now these values here will
be college names that
will be the domain that we're
drawing from but we'll calling
home and satellite to distinguish their roles in the association.
Now what about keys?
We said before that every
campus, every satellite campus
has exactly one home campus so we write it that way.
And that a home campus could have,
I think we said something like
zero to ten satellite campuses but
in terms of generating our relations
the only really important thing
is this one to one and
if you remember what our rules
said, it said that
if we have one one to
one on one side then
the other side is a
key in the association relation.
So what that would tell us
is that satellite is a
key here and that does
make sense, so we'll only
have each satellites home campus
listed once and, but
a home might have many
satellites so the left hand would not be a key.
Ok, we're getting there.
We finished the first three and now it's time for sub classes.
This is a pretty big one.
First of all, it turns out that
there's well atleast three and
three commonly use translations from
a sub class relationship into
relations so let me
setup a generic sub classing setup
and then we'll talk about the three
different translation and when we might use which one.
So, here's our generic set up, I had to draw it a little funny to fit it in the space.
S is our super class
and then we have two sub
classes S1 and S2
and just as a reminder
what this says is that we
have object of type S
and they have a key attribute
call K and another attribute
call A and then
we have sub classes of those,
one called S1 which will
have attributes K and A
and will also have an attribute
B and the difference to
the sub class as two that
will have attributes K and A
inherited from its parent and
then an additional attribute C. Now
there are three different ways,
as I said, atleast three that we
could translate this UML diagram to relations.
In the first way, we
have a relation for each
of our classes including the sub-classes
and the sub-class relations will contain
their own attributes, plus the key of the super class.
In the second case, we
still have one relation for
each of our three classes, but
in this case the sub-class relation contains
all of the attributes from the
super class and then the
third case we just use
one mega relation for the
whole thing that contains all
of the super class and sub-class attributes.
So let's take a look at
what the three different translations
would produce for this particular setup.
For the first one we'll have
our relation for S that's
going to have K and A,
then we'll have one relation for
each of the two sub-classes, S1,
that will contain the key
for the super class, so it
will be K and that
will still be a key here for
the sub-class and B. So,
to find all components of
an object of S1 will
get it's A competent from
the super class, following that key, and then, we'll get the B component.
from this relation and then
finally say S2 will be
similar, it will have the
key for the super class
and attribute C, again what
this will require is some assembly
to get all attributes of the sub classes.
Now, let's look at the second translation.
We still have the super class,
and our sub classes now
are going to contain all of
the attributes that are relevant
so they'll have the key attribute from the super class.
They'll also have attribute A
and attribute B and then
S2 will similarly have
K and then A
and then C. So in
this case what we can see is
that when we have an object
that's in a sub class all
of it's information will be in
it's sub class relation and the
super class will only be
used for objects that are
in the super class but not in any of the sub classes.
And the third translation says, let's
just make a mega relation that contains everything.
So, it will have the key
attribute K and A
and B and C. And
in that case, we can
see that we may have some
null values, so if we
have an object that's only
in sub class as one for
example, it would then
have a null attribute C. If
we add an object that was
only in the super class and
not in any of the sub
classes it would have a
null for both B and C.
Now as you may have noticed,
what has already been on
the slide the entire time is
that the best translation may depend
on the properties of the sub
class relationship and if
you remember, we had the properties
overlapping versus disjoint, and complete versus incomplete.
So overlapping meant that we
might have objects that were
in more than one sub class,
disjoint meant that's not possible,
complete said that every
object that's in the super
class and the super class
is also in at least
one of the sub classes, where incomplete
said that there would be some
objects, or they could be they're
in the super class and not in any sub classes.
Sort of, alluded to how
some of those properties affect the different translations.
But, let's look at it very specifically.
Let's suppose, for example, that
we had a heavily overlapping
sub class relationship.
In other words, we have many
objects that are in multiple
subclasses; if that's the
case then we might prefer
design three because design
three captures all of
the different attributes in one
place so if many objects have
all those attributes we might
like to just have them together
rather than needing to assemble them from the different pieces.
On the other hand, let's say
that we have have a disjoint
and furthermore, let's say it's complete.
So, we have every
element being in exactly one
subclass and there are no
elements elements that are in just the super class.
So in that case, we might
like to use design two because
design two puts each object
in individual subclass relation and
furthermore, since it's complete, we
could actually, in this particular
case, get rid of the first relation.
We wouldn't need that, and so
the best design would be number
2, modified to only have the subclass relations.
So, now, let's revisit our
gigantic example from the
UML modeling video and see how that would be translated to relations.
So, just to remind you
what's going on in this big
diagram we have students, and
students have a student
ID and a name and then
some of our students might be foreign students and they have a country.
Some of our students may be domestic
students, and that they would
have a state and a social security number.
We'll assume that every student
is either foreign or domestic, and
then some of our
students are AP students and interestingly,
they have no attributes but, those
are the ones who have an association
called took with AP
courses AP courses have
a course number and a
title and then, when a
student takes an AP course,
there's an association class that
says the year they took it and the grade they got.
So, let's translate this to relations; the whole diagram.
And we're going to use the first
translation from our three schemes.
So, that's the one where the
sub-class relations contain the
super class keys and then all the specialized attributes.
So, let's start by generating
the relation for the student class
and that's straightforward, that's just the
student ID and the student
name, with the student ID being the key.
And, then we're going to generate one
relation for each of our three sub-classes.
So that would be the foreign
students which will take
the key then from the
student relations, so their student
ID and the country that they're from.
They'll be the domestic students and
there we'll have again, the student
ID, inherited from the super
class and the state
they're from and their social security number.
And, then we'll also have the AP
students and those have
none of their own attributes but,
we can get the key,
and we do, from the super class.
So, this is just going to be
a list of the student ID's who are AP students.
Now, let's keep going.
So, let's take a look at AP students taking courses.
So, we'll have, from the
AP class, a
straight forward translation to the
course number and the
title of the course and
then, finally, we're going to
have a relation for the
fact that a AP student took classes.
We had some multiplicities on that
the first time but, neither of
them were a zero one or
one one so they're not going to be relevant in changing our design.
So, took is going to have the key from both sides.
Well, we don't see any key in here do we?
But, subclasses always inherit
the key from their parents, so
the key here is implicitly
the student ID and, that's what we'll be using here.
Student ID, the key
from the right hand side, the
course number, that they've taken
and then we'll have the two
attributes from the association class,
the year and the grade.
So this actually looks like a pretty good design.
Let me just make a few comments.
The first one has to do with the AP student relation.
So if every AP student
does have to, does have to take at least one course.
So, if we have, for example,
a one dot dot something
over there, then, we could
actually eliminate it's relation because
every student ID that
appears in AP student, will
also appear in the
Took relation, so, this one
will be redundant in that case.
So, again, that could be
eliminated based on the multiplicity,
though, I wouldn't really expect an
automatic translator to necessarily figure that one out.
Another possibility I should mention,
is that we could have a primary
key specified here for
domestic students for social security
numbers since we would expect that
to be unique, and that
would translate to a key
here, but let me be clear, this would be a separate key.
It wouldn't be social security number and
student ID together, but these
would be two different keys and
in SQL you can actually distinguish
between those two, but we
can't do it the way we've written the relations here.
And, finally let me mention again
that requirement that we
have keys for regular classes
if we want to do translation
automatically and you might
have noticed that for example, we
certainly didn't have a key here
for a foreign student with country
being the only attribute, but subclasses
are also not considered regular classes.
So subclasses and association
classes don't need to have keys
and we can still have an automatic translation.
Logically subclasses are inheriting
their keys from their super-class
and that one does need to
have a key in order to have automatic translation.
